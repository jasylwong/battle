About
---------

This app is based on the [Makers Week 3 challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/intro_to_the_web).

The overall objective is to create a game that allows to players to battle against each other. 
The learning object is to set up a basic project structure using our newly learned skills in Sinatra, RSpec, and Capybara.
